### About
* **Author**: [Erick SimÃµes](https://github.com/ErickSimoes)
* **Time to complete the project**: 10h
* **Minimum API Level**: Android 4.4
* **Target platform**: Android 7.0
* **Unity Version**: 2017.1.0f3
* **Google VR SDK Version**: GVR Unity v1.60.0
* **I liked**: Mount the scenery and create the fade in and out effects.
* **It was challenging**: Develop the project in the newer version of Unity and the GVR plugin, where not everything worked the same way as previous versions.
